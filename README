= Description
  A gem that ensures only one instance of your main script is running.
  In short, there can be only one.

= Synopsis
  require 'highlander'
  # Your code here

= Notes
  Simply requiring the highlander gem ensures that only one instance
  of that script cannot be started again. If you try to start it again
  it will raise a RuntimeError.
